README for Calcify
Introduction
This project aims to create an advanced calculator without using the eval() function or any other function that automatically calculates the answer. The calculator is built with JavaScript and utilizes HTML for the structure. It includes a wide range of features such as mathematical evaluations, decimal float warnings, JXGraphs support, and variable assignments.

Prerequisites
You will need the following to set up this project:

A web browser to access the calculator interface.
A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, to edit the JavaScript code.
Installation
To use the advanced calculator, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the calculator interface.
Features
The advanced calculator provides users with the following features:

Support for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Support for mathematical functions such as exponentiation and square root.
Support for assigning values to variables like x, y, and z.
Decimal float warning, which notifies users if their input includes a decimal value.
JXGraphs support, which enables users to visualize their input in a graph.
